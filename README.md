# Yelp Summarization Miner (YUMM)

**Y**elp s**UM**marization **M**iner (or **YUMM**) is an automated system--based on natural language processing and machine learning--for generating a digestable, human-understandable, and browsable summary of the opinions expressed in a corpus of Yelp reviews about a particular restaurant. YUMM's summary aims to provide the user with an at-a-glance understanding of a restaurant's features (or *aspects*) as well as reviewers' attitudes towards these features. 

You can check out a demo of YUMM online [here](http://www.jeffreyfossett.com). If that's not your style, here's a screenshot of YUMM in action (for a restaurant called **Zinburger**):
